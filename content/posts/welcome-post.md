# Welcome to My New Website

This is the inaugural post on my new personal website. I built this site using Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator. The site features a clean, minimalist design with both light and dark modes for comfortable reading in any environment.

## Why Hugo?

I chose Hugo for several reasons:

1. **Speed**: Hugo is incredibly fast at building sites, even with thousands of pages.
2. **Markdown support**: As someone comfortable with Markdown, Hugo's native support makes content creation seamless.
3. **Flexibility**: Hugo's templating system allows for extensive customization without sacrificing simplicity.
4. **Git integration**: The entire site lives in a Git repository, making version control and collaboration straightforward.

## What to Expect

This website will serve as a hub for my:

- **Blog posts**: Regular updates on topics I'm passionate about
- **Essays**: Longer-form, more polished pieces of writing
- **Projects**: Showcases of my work and side projects
- **Series**: Collections of related content organized by theme
- **Videos**: Recordings of talks, tutorials, and other video content

## Code Sample

Here's a simple code snippet showing how to create a new Hugo post from the command line:

```bash
hugo new blog/welcome-post.md
```

And here's what a basic front matter looks like in Hugo:

```yaml

title: "My Post Title"

tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]

```

## Next Steps

I'll be regularly updating this site with new content. Feel free to explore the different sections, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thanks for visiting!
