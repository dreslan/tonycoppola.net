# Hi, I'm Tony

I'm a technologist with a growing interest in the field of AI safety and alignment.

> "One way of looking at human creativity is as a process of pulling balls out of a giant urn. The balls represent possible ideas, discoveries, technological inventions... What we haven't extracted, so far, is a black ball: a technology that invariably or by default destroys the civilization that invents it." â€” Nick Bostrom

Is AI a black ball? I think the jury is still out, but frontier models have been improving quickly, and it no longer feels like science fiction to say that we will find out very soon.

With that thought in mind, I created this website to engage in the topic and find out what researchers are doing to make the technology safe, what gaps exist still, and maybe, just maybe, to contribute research directly if I can.

It will be a long hill to climb - I haven't inverted a matrix or calculated a derivative in over 10 years. So, I figure why not document the steps along the way? Maybe someone else in a similar situation will find something on here useful.

Let's go!
